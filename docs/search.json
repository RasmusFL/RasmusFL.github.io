We explore the algorithm from a practical perspective by implementing the method from scratch in Julia and analysing several real datasets as well as a simulated dataset from life insurance. We furthermore investigate the theoretical properties of the algorithm by stating and proving consistency. The final part of the project concerns an extension of the random survival forest to multi-state models. We describe estimation in such a model and establish a new result on consistency for a single tree under the Markov assumption.\n\n\nLecture notes in Quantitative Risk Management\nI wrote lecture notes for the course Quantitative Risk Management during my 6th year. A second draft is here. Should you want solutions to exercises or have you found typos, you are very welcome to write to me.\n\n\nA tour of the Eisenstein integers\nA short note on the ring of Eisenstein integers is available here. My motivation for writing these notes is twofold. First of all, when writing my bachelor project, I swept a lot of details under the rug when implementing the algorithms for the Eisenstein integers. Second, I have not been able to find a comprehensive description of this ring online. This paper hopefully constitutes a thorough introduction.\n\n\nLecture notes in Stochastic Processes in Non-Life Insurance\nI wrote lecture notes for the course Stochastic Processes in Non-Life Insurance (abbreviated SkadeStok) during my 6th year. A first draft is here.\n\n\n(First) Bachelor’s thesis\nI wrote my first bachelor project in cubic and quartic reciprocity with perspectives to class field theory. My supervisor was Ian Kiming. I first present the necessary machinery needed to give elementary (but somewhat tedious) proofs of the two main theorems, namely Cubic Reciprocity and Quartic Reciprocity. Afterwards, I take a dive into Kummer theory and class field theory in order to obtain a more high level proof of cubic reciprocity. I also spent some time writing and implementing algorithms to compute the cubic and quartic residue symbols in C++. The code is found in the following repositories:\n\nGaussian integers\nEisenstein integers\n\nNote that in order to compile the code, you need the GMP library. For many, it is likely easier to rewrite the essential algorithms in another language.\nA revised version of the complete project can be found here. In the revised version, a few errors and typos have been corrected. The last section on class field theory likely has some errors remaining."

    "text": "Danish Youth Association of Science/Ungdommens Naturvidenskabelige Forening (UNF)\nI have done all sorts of work for UNF through the years. A brief overview is in my CV. Below follows a more comprehensive description. I started as a volunteer in 2016, and I am still active. A list of projects, I have been involved in, is below. Note that all attached material is in Danish.\n\nUNF Science Weekend/Naturfagsweekend\nScience Weekend is a weekend camp for 7th - 9th graders. The project started small in 2019 (under the name Masterclass) where we had about 20 participants and just as many volunteers. The year after in 2020, the camp had grown to 65 participants and five subjects (from four the year before). Thankfully, the camp took place right before the COVID-19 lockdowns. Thanks to an extraordinary funding, we even held the camp another time in 2020, namely in the summer holidays (with restrictions of course). The following year the camp took place twice, again with 65 participants and a new name, Science Weekend. In 2022, we scaled up further to 85 participants and more than 30 volunteers along with six subjects, and again the camp was held twice. The camp was held twice in 2023 as well.\nMy role in the camp has evolved as follows:\n\n2019: Teacher in chemistry.\n2020: Teacher in mathematics (subject: graph theory) and assistant coordinator.\n2021: Coordinator and teacher in mathematics (subject: number theory).\n2022: Coordinator and teacher in mathematics (subject: graph theory version 2).\n2023: Coordinator and teacher in mathematics (subject: set theory and probability theory).\n\nFor those interested, the material from the camps are below:\n\n2019 Material\n2020 Material (first camp)\n2020 Material (second camp, minor changes and corrections)\n2021 Material\n2022 Material\n2023 Material\n\n\n\nUNF Mathematics Camp\nUNF Mathematics Camp has been held since 2007 and is but one of many UNF summer camps. In fact, a (Danish) Wikipedia article is dedicated to keeping track of them. My role in the project is as follows:\n\n2020 (cancelled due to COVID-19): Assistant teacher.\n2021: Assistant teacher.\n2022: Teacher (subject: probability theory). Material\n2023: Teacher (subject: applied linear algebra). Material\n2024: Teacher (subject: ring theory). Material\n\nI took part in writing the material in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\nLectures\nI have helped as a volunteer in many evening lectures in UNF. I have also arranged a number of lectures in mathematics.\n\n\nWorkshops\nI have taught several workshops in mathematics. A list is below:\n\nDifferential calculus: Material, presentation\nIntegral calculus: Material, presentation\nDifferential equations: Material, presentation\nLinear algebra: Material, presentation\nSeries and sequences: Material, presentation\nNumber theory: Material, presentation\nGraph theory: Material, presentation\nVectors and parametrized curves: Material, presentation\n\n\n\nEvenings of Natural Science Education\nFrom May to September 2022, I took part in teaching young Ukrainian refugees in Copenhagen. I also did some of the administrative work.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nI had the role of secretary in the local branch UNF Copenhagen from July 2020 to March 2021. I was night watchman at Chemistry Camp 2019 and Computer Science Camp 2023. I was teacher at Machine Learning Camp 2024, teaching in the mathematical prerequisites for machine learning, including linear algebra, probability theory and basic regression."
