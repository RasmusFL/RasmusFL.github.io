## Welcome to my website! 

This website contains more or less all you need to know about me. More things to come. Feel free to explore! 

## Who am I?

I am a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen in the section of Insurance and Economics. My principal supervisor is [Martin Rainer Bladt](https://www.martinbladt.com/) and my co-supervisor is [Mogens Steffensen](https://sites.google.com/site/steffensenmogens/). My interests are probability theory, statistics and insurance, in particular statistics related to life insurance. I also like to teach mathematics among other things.
