## Academic interests

My interests evolve around probability theory, insurance and statistics. I am very interested in different aspects of life insurance, including valuation and estimation in multi-state models. 

## Other interests

I love reading, especially science fiction (Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert are among my favorites) and fantasy (Narnia and The Lord of The Rings especially). I am also learning German.

As for interests not involving reading, I like to run, preferably around three times a week. Teaching mathematics is also a hobby of mine.

In regards to music, I like many different genres. I am fond of rock, metal (especially power metal) and synthwave. Most popular music from the 50s to the 90s is also a hit.
