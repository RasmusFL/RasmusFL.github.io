In this tab is a collection of all projects, I find relevant to share.

### Lecture notes in Quantitative Risk Management

I wrote lecture notes for the course Quantitative Risk Management during my 6th year. A first draft is [here](Documents/QRM.pdf). Should you want solutions to exercises or have you found typos, you are very welcome to write to me.

### A tour of the Eisenstein integers

A short note on the ring of Eisenstein integers is available [here](Documents/EI.pdf). My motivation for writing these notes is twofold. First of all, when writing my bachelor project, I swept a lot of details under the rug when implementing the algorithms for the Eisenstein integers. Second, I have not been able to find a comprehensive description of this ring online. This paper hopefully constitutes a thorough introduction.

### Lecture notes in Stochastic Processes in Non-Life Insurance
I wrote lecture notes for the course Stochastic Processes in Non-Life Insurance (abbreviated SkadeStok) during my 6th year. A first draft is [here](Documents/SkadeStok.pdf).

### (First) Bachelor's thesis
I wrote my first bachelor project in cubic and quartic reciprocity with perspectives to class field theory. My supervisor was Ian Kiming. I first present the necessary machinery needed to give elementary (but somewhat tedious) proofs of the two main theorems, namely Cubic Reciprocity and Quartic Reciprocity. Afterwards, I take a dive into Kummer theory and class field theory in order to obtain a more high level proof of cubic reciprocity. I also spent some time writing and implementing algorithms to compute the cubic and quartic residue symbols in C++. The code is found in the following repositories:

* [Gaussian integers](https://github.com/RasmusFL/GaussianIntegers)
* [Eisenstein integers](https://github.com/RasmusFL/EisensteinIntegers)

Note that in order to compile the code, you need the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/). For many, it is likely easier to rewrite the essential algorithms in another language.

A revised version of the complete project can be found [here](Documents/project_revised.pdf). In the revised version, a few errors and typos have been corrected. The last section on class field theory likely has some errors remaining.
