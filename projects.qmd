In this tab is a collection of all projects, I find relevant to share.

## (First) Bachelor's thesis
I wrote my first bachelor project in cubic and quartic reciprocity with perspectives to class field theory. My supervisor was Ian Kiming. I first present the necessary machinery needed to give elementary (but somewhat tedious) proofs of the two main theorems, namely Cubic Reciprocity and Quartic Reciprocity. Afterwards, I take a dive into Kummer theory and class field theory in order to obtain a more high level proof of cubic reciprocity. I also spent some time writing and implementing algorithms to compute the cubic and quartic residue symbols in C++. The code is found in the following repositories:

* [Gaussian integers](https://github.com/RasmusFL/GaussianIntegers)
* [Eisenstein integers](https://github.com/RasmusFL/EisensteinIntegers)

Note that in order to compile the code, you need the [GMP library](https://gmplib.org/). For many, it is likely easier to rewrite the essential algorithms in another language.

A revised version of the complete project can be found [here](project_revised.pdf). In the revised version, a few errors and typos have been corrected. The last section on class field theory likely has some errors remaining.
